"""
Deterministic regression guard for the rem rules in check_blocks (analyze_batch.py).

Two measured facts, both easy to get backwards:

  * nothing ends a rem. An inline `rem` comments out the rest of the LINE - `&`, `|`
    and `)` included - so on `if 1==1 (echo a & rem note & echo b)` the block never
    closes: measured, nothing after the '(' ran, exit 255, no message.
  * cmd runs a piped block - either side of the pipe - in a child after folding its
    lines into ONE line joined with `&`, so a rem anywhere in it comments out the rest
    of that line, the block's own ')' included. Measured: the child runs nothing from
    the block, not even the lines before the rem; no message, and the script carries on.

Runs the analyzer against rem_regression.cmd and asserts the EXACT sets, both ways:
every MUSTEAT line is reported rem-eats-paren, every MUSTPIPE line rem-in-piped-block,
no other line is reported by either, and the fixture stays balanced. The SAFE twins are
the shapes a careless version would flag: a rem in a redirected (not piped) block, a
comment hoisted above a piped block, `||` on either side of a block, a line-leading
`@rem` whose ')' was never meant to close anything, an inline rem at top level, an
inline rem whose parens are its own, and a quoted "& rem".

Run:  python3 tests/test_rem_regression.py
Exit: 0 = pass, 1 = a detection regression or a new false positive.
