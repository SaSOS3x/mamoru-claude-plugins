"""
Deterministic regression guard for check_blocks in analyze_batch.py.

Runs the analyzer against paren_regression.cmd and asserts the EXACT set
of flagged lines - in both directions, which is the point:

  * every line whose text contains MUSTFLAG must be reported block-paren-literal
    (guards that the detector still fires - catches a refactor that reopens a
    blind spot), and
  * every line whose text contains MUSTERR must be reported block-early-close, and
  * NO other line may be flagged (guards against false positives - catches a
    refactor that makes the detector fire on safe code).

The fixture pairs each buggy case with its safe twin, including the exact
false-positive traps that surfaced while widening the check (a legit
`( echo a & echo b )`, a quoted-if with a clean body, a quoted `set "x=(y)"`,
top-level parens, escaped `^(...^)`, and for-in structural parens).

Run:  python3 tests/test_paren_regression.py
Exit: 0 = pass, 1 = a detection regression or a new false positive.
