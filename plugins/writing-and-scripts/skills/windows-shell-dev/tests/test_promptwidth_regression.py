"""
Deterministic regression guard for check_prompt_width in analyze_batch.py.

Runs the analyzer against promptwidth_regression.cmd and asserts the EXACT set of
prompt-width lines, both directions:

  * every set /p line whose text contains MUSTFLAG is reported prompt-width, and
  * NO other prompt is - the SAFE twins must stay clean.

The SAFE twins are the shapes that would false-positive if the check were written
carelessly: a prompt one column under the limit, a short one, the fixed form with the
explanation moved to an echo line above, the `set /p VAR=<file` read-from-file idiom
(which has no prompt at all), a commented-out long prompt, and one where `%%` renders
as a single percent so the visible text is shorter than the source.

A second pass strips the `mode con` line and asserts the check goes completely silent -
a script that never declares a width could be running in any terminal, and guessing one
would invent findings.

Run:  python3 tests/test_promptwidth_regression.py
Exit: 0 = pass, 1 = a detection regression or a new false positive.
