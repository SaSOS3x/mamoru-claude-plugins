"""
Deterministic regression guard for the call-fallthrough and comment-in-block
rules in analyze_batch.py.

Runs the analyzer against callfall_regression.cmd and asserts the EXACT set of
flagged lines in both directions:

  * every line under "rem --- FLAG-CF:" must be reported call-fallthrough, and
    every line under "rem --- FLAG-CB:" must be reported comment-in-block
    (guards that the detectors still fire - a routine called from directly above
    its own label runs twice and its exit /b then ends the whole batch, which
    presents as "the menu never opens" rather than as a crash), and

  * NO other line may be flagged. That half is the harder one and is why the
    fixture carries five clean shapes: a call guarded by a goto, a call that
    transfers control on its own line (`|| goto`), a call with real work between
    it and the label, an echo that merely mentions a call, and - for the block
    rule - `rem` inside a block, `::` at top level, and `::` indented under the
    `if not X goto skip` idiom, which LOOKS like it is inside a block and is not.
    That last one is why the rule reads block depth from the parser simulation
    instead of from indentation.
