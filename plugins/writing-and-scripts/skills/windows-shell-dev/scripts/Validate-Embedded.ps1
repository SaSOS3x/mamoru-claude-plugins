.SYNOPSIS
    Parse-validate every embedded PowerShell command inside a .cmd/.bat file,
    and optionally a PS1 test harness, using the real PowerShell parser.

.DESCRIPTION
    extract_ps.py gives a fast dependency-free lint, but only the actual
    PowerShell language parser can tell you a one-liner is genuinely valid.
    This script extracts each `powershell ... -Command "..."` body and runs it
    through [System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseInput, and can
    also parse-check (and run) a harness such as tests/Run-Tests.ps1.

    Exit code is nonzero if any snippet or the harness fails to parse, so it
    slots into CI next to the batch analyzer. Exit codes: 0 = valid (or no
    embedded PowerShell found - a warning is printed then), 1 = a snippet or the
    harness is bad, 2 = a file named on the command line does not exist.

    Works in Windows PowerShell 5.1 (powershell.exe, built into Windows) and in
    pwsh 7. In a snippet, \" (the way powershell.exe's command line writes a
    quote) is turned into " before parsing.

.PARAMETER CmdFile
    Path to the .cmd/.bat file whose embedded PowerShell should be validated.

.PARAMETER Harness
    Optional path to a .ps1 test harness to parse-check.

.PARAMETER RunHarness
    If set, also execute the harness (after it parses cleanly).

.EXAMPLE
    powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Validate-Embedded.ps1 -CmdFile PerfTweaks.cmd
    pwsh -NoProfile -File Validate-Embedded.ps1 -CmdFile PerfTweaks.cmd
    pwsh -NoProfile -File Validate-Embedded.ps1 -CmdFile PerfTweaks.cmd -Harness tests/Run-Tests.ps1 -RunHarness
